{: .intro }
There is a significant difference between a prototype and a production-ready application. The former is meant to serve
as a proof-of-concept and should only run on your computer for a 10-minute demo. The latter must be able to run
unattended 24/7 at minimal operating costs. Metalama helps you transition your app from prototype to production with
less boilerplate and fewer errors.
