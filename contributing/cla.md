title: Contribution License Agreement
---

{: .intro }
When you submit your first pull request to a repository under the Metalama organization on GitHub, you'll be asked to sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) shown below. This agreement is based on the same text used by the .NET Foundation, with the only difference being that the recipient is SharpCrafters s.r.o., the core maintainer of the project. Signing the CLA is a standard requirement that ensures all contributions can be legally used and redistributed as part of the project.

This Contribution License Agreement (“Agreement”) is between SharpCrafters s.r.o. with its registered office at Prague 5, nám. 11. října 1307/2, Postal Code 150 00, the Czech Republic, ID 28953690 (“Maintainer”), and the person or entity signing below (“You”).

This Agreement conveys certain license rights to Maintainer for Your contributions to Maintainer’s open source projects. This Agreement is effective as of the latest signature date below ("Effective Date").

**Project** means any of the projects owned or managed by Maintainer and offered under a license approved by the [Open Source Initiative](http://www.opensource.org/).

**Submit** is the act of uploading, submitting, transmitting, or distributing code or other content to any Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of discussing and improving that Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Submission."

You must agree to the terms of this Agreement before making a Submission to any Project. This Agreement covers any and all Submissions that You, now or in the future (except as described in Section 4 below), Submit to any Project.

#### 3. Originality of Work

You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work. Should You wish to Submit materials that are not Your original work, You may Submit them separately to the Project if You (a) retain all copyright and license information that was in the materials as you received them, (b) in the description accompanying your Submission, include the phrase "Submission containing materials of a third party:" followed by the names of the third party and any licenses or other restrictions of which You are aware, and (c) follow any other instructions in the Project's written guidelines concerning Submissions.

#### 4. Licenses

1. **Copyright License.** You grant Maintainer, and those who receive the Code directly or indirectly from Maintainer, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license in the Submission to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute the Submission and such derivative works, and to sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third parties under any terms at Maintainer’s sole discretion.
2. **Patent License.** You grant Maintainer, and those who receive the Code directly or indirectly from Maintainer, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license under your patent claims that directly read on the Code to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import or otherwise dispose of the Code.
3. **Other Rights Reserved.** Each party reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement. No additional licenses or rights whatsoever (including, without limitation, any implied licenses) are granted by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.

#### 4. Representations and Warranties

UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, AND EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTIONS 3, AND 5, THE SUBMISSION PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OF NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  

#### 5. Notice to Maintainer

You agree to notify Maintainer in writing of any facts or circumstances of which You later become aware that would make Your representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.
