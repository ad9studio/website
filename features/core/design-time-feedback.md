title: Immediate Editor Feedback
---

{: .intro }
Metalama executes both within the compiler process and the IDE. Your aspects are executed whenever a relevant change is
detected in the code. 

Therefore, you don't need to build your project to see warnings and errors or to reference
generated artifacts in your source code.
