title: Divorcing from Metalama
---

{: .intro }
We understand the risks you are undertaking by taking a dependency on Metalama, and we made as simple as possible to remove it from your projects.

We publish a [producedure](https://doc.metalama.net/conceptual/divorcing) and tools to write the generated code back into the source code repository. You can then use any `git` tool to review the changes, and commit the generated code back in your source repo.

{: .warning }
Metalama Divorce is not designed to be executed regularly. As any divorce, breaking up from Metalama is painful, and might take from hours to days depending on the size of your projects. We wanted to make it as smooth as _possible_.

## Benefits
