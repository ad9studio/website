                                        Manually writing boilerplate is not only boring and frustrating, but also a
                                        total waste of your time. Why manually do what a machine can accomplish more
                                        efficiently and swiftly?

                                        Although allowing architecture to erode initially saves time, as it
                                        progressively accumulates, it makes everyone on the team less productive.

                                        If your business logic is cluttered with boilerplate, the source code
                                        becomes so complex that it's no longer comprehensible.

                                        As the source code diverges from the original architecture, more exceptions
                                        to the rule are introduced, increasing the conceptual complexity of the

                                        Boilerplate is often riddled with bugs because it's created by copy-paste
                                        programming and is largely untested. Production-readiness features such as
                                        logging or caching are neglected because they are too costly to build
                                        without the appropriate tools.

                                        A larger refactoring becomes completely unfeasible, necessitating a complete

                         Simple, Robust Meta-Programming</h2>


                        <p>
                            <i>Meta-programming</i> is the practice of writing code that generates, modifies, or
                            validates other code. This approach streamlines repetitive tasks and makes code reviews more
                            efficient.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a focus on <b>simplicity</b> and <b>safety</b>, we have reimagined <i>aspect-oriented
                                programming (AOP)</i> for modern .NET applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>Aspects and fabrics are <i>meta</i> C# classes that execute within the compiler or the IDE
                            and perform the following tasks:</p>
                        <ul class="list-smallBlueTags">
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Generate repetitive code</b> at compile-time, ensuring your source code remains
                                    crystal clear.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Unlike Roslyn generators, Metalama is not limited
                                    to extending <code>partial</code> classes. You can add behaviors to hand-written
                                    methods, properties, and even fields.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Verify source code</b> against patterns and architectural rules. Use a fluent C# API
                                to express common rules or build
                                your own rules. Report errors in real-time in the IDE or at build time in you CI
                                pipeline.</li>
                            <li><b>Suggest</b> code fixes and refactorings, and provide guidance to developers.</li>

                        <p><b>Do it by your rules.</b> Create your own code templates and verification rules easily and

                        Aspects are <i>meta</i> classes that transform code using simple C#-based templates. They can
                        also report warnings and errors or suggest code fixes.

                    <p>
                        Here is an aspect that automatically adds logging to a method:

                        It may seem simplistic, and it is. Dozens of open-source aspects are available on <a

                        A <i>fabric</i> is a specific kind of class that executes at build time or within the IDE.
                        Unlike aspects, fabrics do not need to be applied to anything. They serve as their own entry
                        points.

                                    consistency and streamlines reviews, thereby reducing developer

                                    Metalama's ultimate advantage lies in reducing maintenance costs and
                                    extending the lifespan of the codebase. Given that maintenance accounts
                                    for 55%-95% of a software system's costs, maintaining low complexity is
                                    crucial for post-release team member productivity. Considering that
                                    developers spend approximately 70% of their time understanding code,
                                    maintaining simplicity significantly enhances the efficiency of the
                                    maintenance team.

                            is intricate, demanding years of experience. When approached naively,
                            low-level meta-programming can resemble hacking and can significantly amplify
                            complexity, especially after the departure of the developer who implemented the
                            meta-code.

                            need to juggle a combination of Roslyn APIs that lack integration.
